This blog was mainly developed in order to:
- Improve my coding skills, since it was all written in R
- Serve as a personal repository of my own reflections and learning
- Act somewhat as a portfolio, since I'll be posting some content that might be of interest of someone

And since this is an About section, I'll talk a little bit about myself

I'm Sergio Wang, firstborn of two immigrants from Taiwan, and raised in Brazil. I'm currently working as a Data Scientist, which is something that I've yearned for a few years, and hope to keep working with data science for many years to come.

Some things that I'm quite interested in are:
- Animes
- Violin playing (especially classical music) :violin:
- Sports (basketball and crossfit) :basketball:
- Plant-based recipes :seedling: (not vegan though)

If anything, I'm always accessible through my social networks, so feel free to reach out, even if just to chat

Hope you enjoy your stay here
